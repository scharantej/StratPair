## Design for Reinforcement Learning (RL) for Pair Trading App

**HTML Files:**

1. **index.html**:
   - Serves as the homepage of the app.
   - Provides a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the RL model.
   - Includes elements such as buttons, text fields, and graphs for visualization.
   - Contains JavaScript code for handling user input and sending requests to the Flask server.

2. **results.html**:
   - Displays the results generated by the RL model, including graphs of stock prices and potential trading strategies.
   - Provides a table summarizing the performance metrics of the RL model.
   - Allows users to explore different scenarios and parameters by modifying input values on the homepage and submitting them for re-evaluation.

3. **about.html**:
   - Presents information about the RL for pair trading app and its purpose.
   - Includes a brief explanation of the underlying reinforcement learning algorithms used in the app.
   - Provides contact details for users to reach out with questions or feedback.

**Routes:**

1. **Home Route (`/`)**:
   - Renders the `index.html` page, acting as the entry point for users.
   - Handles user inputs such as stock symbols, trading parameters, and risk tolerance.
   - Validates user inputs and forwards them to the appropriate route for processing.

2. **Results Route (`/results`)**:
   - Receives the validated user inputs from the home route.
   - Utilizes the RL model to generate trading strategies and performance metrics based on the provided parameters.
   - Renders the `results.html` page, displaying the generated results in a user-friendly format.

3. **About Route (`/about`)**:
   - Renders the `about.html` page, providing information about the app, its methodology, and the team behind it.
   - Serves as a resource for users to learn more about the RL for pair trading app and its functionality.

4. **API Route (`/api/v1/rl`)**:
   - Serves as a RESTful API endpoint for external applications or advanced users to interact with the RL model directly.
   - Receives JSON requests containing user inputs and returns JSON responses with the generated trading strategies and performance metrics.
   - Allows for integration with other systems or automated trading platforms.

5. **Error Route (`/error`)**:
   - Handles any unexpected errors or exceptions that may occur during the execution of the app.
   - Displays a user-friendly error message and provides guidance on how to resolve the issue.
